# Current frontend
~ XML Layout (regular layout vs page layout)
~ Block classes (and/or ViewModel classes)
~ PHTML templates
~ RequireJS
~ KnockoutJS
~ Magento JS libraries
~ Knockout HTML templates

---
# New frontend: React
~ React
    - Component-based
    - Close to native JS
    - JSX

~ Redux
~ GraphQL

---
# Why React?
~ Most popular JS library of this moment
~ Learning curve much smaller than M2 frontend
~ Rich community, many resources
~ More devs available than for M2
~ Or would Vue have been a better choice?

### Nah, Vue is for Polish people

---
# Why GraphQL?
~ Introduced in Magento 2.3
~ More performant/flexible than REST
~ You only receive what you request
~ Multiple requests in 1 HTTP request
~ Commands, Queries, Mutations

---
# Magento PWA Studio
~ Introduced in Magento 2.3
~ Venia theme
~ Peregrine components
~ Buildpack
~ Third party components
~ UPWARD specification

# Current state of PWA

### Crossing-over strategies

---
# Crossing-over
- Never
- In 3 years time
- Now (full PWA)
- Now (hybrid)

---
# Hybrid
- Vue or React components in current frontend
- Replace full page (CMS, catalog, checkout)
- Examples
    - https://github.com/yireo-training/Yireo_ReactMinicart
    - https://reacticon.org/media/martins-at-reacticon.pdf
    - IntegerNet React checkout

---
# My advice
~ Base your decisions on your own experience
~ PWA is the future, so you should experiment with it
~ React development is a breeze compared to Knockout
~ Perhaps a hybrid approach is the best option
