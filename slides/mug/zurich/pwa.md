# Why React?
~ Most popular JS library of this moment
~ Learning curve much smaller than M2 frontend
~ Rich community, many resources
~ More devs available than for M2
~ Or would Vue have been a better choice?

### Crossing-over strategies

---
# Crossing-over
- Never
- In 3 years time
- Now (full PWA)
- Now (hybrid)

---
# Hybrid
- Vue or React components in current frontend
- Replace full page (CMS, catalog, checkout)
- Examples
