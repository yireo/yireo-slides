# What is an unconference?

# What is an unconference?
"A loosely structured conference emphasizing the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants, rather than following a conventionally structured programme of events."

# Unconference rules
1. Whoever shows up are the right people
2. Whatever happens is fine
3. Whenever it starts is the right time
4. It is over when it is over
