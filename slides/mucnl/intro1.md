# What is an unconference?

# What is an unconference?

"A loosely structured conference emphasizing the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants, rather
than following a conventionally structured programme of events."

---

# Unconference rules

1. Whoever shows up are the right people
2. Whatever happens is fine
3. Whenever it starts is the right time
4. It is over when it is over

# Law of two feet

If you find yourself in a situation where you are not contributing or learning, move somewhere where you can.
