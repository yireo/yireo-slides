# What is PWA?

# The real revolution is headless

---
{state: dark}
# What is headless development?
~ Decoupling frontend from backend
    - Independent progress in separate teams (backend dev, frontend dev)
    - Frontend devs need to know less about their backend application
~ Magento as a remote API instead of a monolith
    - Magento always sucked in some places, especially its CMS and frontend
~ Option for an unopinionated middleware layer
    - Connections with Magento, Shopware, CMS-es
