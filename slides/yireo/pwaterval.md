## Good question
~## but wrong

# First things first

---
# What is PWA?
~ Add-to-homescreen option (manifest.json)
~ Push notifications (service worker)
~ Offline shopping (service worker)

~### You can do this with the current frontend of Magento 2 too

~### ... except for offline shopping

# The real revolution is headless

---
# What is headless development?
~ Decoupling frontend from backend
    - Independent progress in separate teams (backend dev, frontend dev)
    - Frontend devs need to know less about their backend application
~ Magento as a remote API instead of a monolith
    - Magento always sucked in some places, especially its CMS and frontend
~ Option for an unopinionated middleware layer
    - Connections with Magento, Shopware, CMS-es

---
# So what choices to make?
~ JavaScript or PHP?
~ Vue or React?
~ VueStoreFront or Magento PWA Studio or DEITY or ...?
