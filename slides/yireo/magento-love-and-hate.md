# The confusion

# Magento Association updates
~ In 2022, Mathias Schreiber joined as executive director
~ Ties with Smithbucklin were broken
~ Adobe remains its funding to the Magento Association
~ Right to use brands "Magento Open Source" and "Meet Magento"
~ Adobe Board Liaisons are increasingly active (Ritesh Somani and Parul Sinha)

# Adobe updates
- Magento Open Source Community Prioritization Process
- Regular software updates to Adobe Commerce / Magento
- Better communications with Magento Association and Mage-OS
- Adobe stopped advertizing with "Magento is now Adobe Commerce"

---
# Mage-OS updates
- Cool stuff is coming
  - New Admin UI
  - ChatGPT product data
  - Admin assistant
- Contributions back to Magento Open Source

---
# Current balance
- Adobe Commerce: Enterprise clients
- Magento Association: Promote Magento brand
- Mage-OS: Build new stuff (Magento Community Council)

---
# "Poke the bear"
- Reorientation
- Everyone is willing, things will become friendly

---
# A smaller Magento
- Use Mage-OS
- Use composer replacements (for instance, via yireo)
- Use Hyva or something else non-PWA and non-KnockoutJS
