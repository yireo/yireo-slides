# We are Magento

# The confusion
- What is Magento?
- Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce or Mage-OS?

---
# Magento Association updates
~ In 2022, Mathias Schreiber joined as executive director
~ Ties with Smithbucklin were broken
~ Adobe remains its funding to the Magento Association
~ Right to use brands "Magento Open Source" and "Meet Magento"
~ Adobe Board Liaisons are increasingly active (Ritesh Somani and Parul Sinha)

# Adobe updates

# Up-to-date Magento 2 overview
- Mage-OS or Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce
- Luma or Hyvä or PWA Studio or ScandiPWA or Breeze
