# 1. Do Use Composer
"Use composer packages to distribute (especially commercial) extensions. For a local environment, it is fine to develop your own code under app/code. However, once you distribute your module to other environments, it should be through composer as otherwise dependencies are left unmanaged. In a production environment, the app/code folder should therefore ideally be empty."
