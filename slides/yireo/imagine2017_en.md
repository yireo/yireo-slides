# Imagine 2017
## Review by Jisse Reitsma

???
Hi everybody, welcome to this screencast on Imagine, the yearly international Magento conference that took place last week (early April) in April. Before we start I have to apologize for my voice a bit, which is a little rusty - not because of partying, but because of a cold I caught in Las Vegas.

# Imagine 2017

--
- Community bits

--
- New products & services

--
- News on Magento 2.2

--
- Techtalk

???
So let's start. Imagine had a lot of things to offer, some really oriented on the community. There were announcements on new products & services, mainly on the last 3rd day of Imagine. I really wanted to take this opportunity to share some of my thoughts on these products. Also, there is some news on Magento 2.2. And, finally, because I'm a developer, there is some techtalk as well.

# Community bits

--
- PreImagine & other parties

--
- Magento Masters

--
- Diversity in Tech

???
So the community was vibrating. For instance, the PreImagine party, sponsored by ShipperHQ, it offered a great way to meet existing friends and make new friends. Besides PreImagine, there were many more other great parties - simply showing that Magento people like to party.

Another part of the community was awarding various people in the community who did great work to help Magento move forward. I'm proud to be a Magento Master as well, but it was even greater to meetup with the other masters.

I'm picking just a few topics, but one noteworthy talk, or actually a panel discussion, was on diversity in tech - a session which discussed the ways that woman specifically can get a better chance to evolve within the tech industry. It was a great session. And I especially loved the involvement of Alaina Percival who represented the organization "Woman Who Code". Agree or disagree, it is an important topic and shows how the Magento community matures.

# New products & services

--
- Magento Security Scanner

--
- Magento Social

--
- Magento Advanced CMS (aka BlueFoot)

--
- Magento Business Intelligence

--
- Magento Shipping (aka Temando)

???
Moving on, some products and services were announced throughout Imagine. First of all, the Magento Security Scanner was revealed, currently in beta. It will allow for a report to be created for your specific Magento instance. Technically, this involves an automated login through SSH, making it an internal scan and not an external scan like the great MageReport tool created by the guys of Hypernode. I signed up for the beta, and am curious how this will come to be.

Magento Social was announced as well: Kind of a Facebook app for product listings, targetting specific customers, ad campaigns, etcetera. Really useful for merchants who want to promote their products via social channels.



Magento Shipping via Fedex UPS, generate picking lists, nice integration in backend but also possible via ShipperHQ

Bluefoot: templating, no frontend developer needed (Joomla/MageBridge), upcoming media gallery

BI: different app, reporting, graphics, data mining, ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Load)

many only for EE
